This situation is somewhat different in a few Member States with long-established chronic amphetamine- or methamphetamine-using populations.

Although problem opioid use is strongly characterised by daily patterns of use, this is often not the case for stimulant drugs.
Assessment of state and trends.
For example, polydrug use problems have become progressively more important in most countries, and some countries where opioid problems (almost exclusively heroin problems) have historically predominated now report changes towards other drugs, such as cocaine.
While globally methamphetamine problems continue to grow, within Europe the drug remains restricted to a few countries with long-established problems.
